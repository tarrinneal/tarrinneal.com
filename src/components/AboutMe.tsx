      My name is Tarrin, and I am a fullstack software engineer. I learned on my
      own off and on for a few years, then decided it was time to really take a
      leap of faith and joined Hack Reactor's full time immersive program.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before joining Hack Reactor I was always worried that I wasn't good enough
      or smart enough to be a software engineer, but in the program I realized
      this is what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I excelled much
      more than I could have hoped for, to the point were I was spending large
      amounts of my time helping the other students with their assignments
      throughout the program.
